New/Bug/Change/Knownbug

Release numbers such as 0.x.x are target releases, starting 0.9.6B releases have a letter,
x.x.xA = initial release on FB.
x.x.xB = fix release on FB.
x.x.xC up to Q more bugs fixed and found
x.x.xRL = official release to github and muffs, target moves up.


version 0.9.6B
N>OSC MODES> added "FILTX" which are filters which work on the other osc, there is (LPoppo)low, (BPoppo)band, and (HPoppo)high pass, as well as a low pass "mistake" that can make some interesting distortion(FKoppo).

C>OSC MODES> changed name of extend to swarm, the original swarm is called detune, and there is a new one called "static" where the saws do not move unless you modulate or turn a parameter knob.

B>INTERNAL> fixed a bug where the modes have been changed in a new firmware, but an old patch, or the internal EEPROM is still trying to use a non existing method for an osc mode, now it will revert to the first method on the osc mode, and ruin your patch instead of crashing.

C>MOD>FUSER> "Invert" fuser has been changed to "LvSHIFT" and is now in the fourth fuser selection. it can still invert, but also level shift: bipolar modulators can be changed to only positive, only negative, and inverted versions of both, positive only modulators can be shifted to become inverted within the positive range, bipolar or inverted bipolar. 


version 0.9.6
N>Hz>PAGE2>CENTER> the glide(portamento) can now be at different rates for the 2 oscillators. the sub will follow according to its "follow" setting, (global has no glide) this can be interesting when using the sub as a modulator.
Right button enables "keyed" glide, it only glides once a key is already pressed. 

note: modulation of glide rate is not working yet, despite controls being present.

B>MODS>SUB Sub was an octave high.

B>SHIFT now returns to screen if you press one of the shift functions, if you press it by it's self, it works as sys button as usual.

C>OSC>BLIND MODES pressing osc a second time no longer enables blind modes, you can get to it by pressing shift(sys)+osc

B>INTERNAL>OSC> WaveEdit was always loading wave 1 on boot up, now it will load the used wavetable for oscs in that mode.

C>ENVELOPE CODE> sometimes a "squeak" could be heard with some combinations of attack/decay/release and lower frequency "smooth" waves, this has been reduced.

C>FX> Effects now show the modulator and modulation amount as a bar similar to the one on attenuverter pages.

C>FX> selection highlight changed from frame to inverted box for better visibility.

N>OSC MODES> New osc mode called "HAX" which is for oddities. there are so far 4 "all mod" controlled oscillators and CV in amplifier for CV a and B. what they sound like will change dependinmmg on what the modulators are doing.

mHARM amplifies 8 harmonices via the LFO and CHAOS modulators. P1 offers a slight detuning of the harmonics, and P2 allows selection of the harmonic sequence (they are the same as the ones in the harmonic mode)

mAMP simply raises or lowers segments of the wave depending on what the modulators are doing, p1 is a "filter" frequency, and p2 is a fade between lowpass and bandpass

mLEN uses 8 modulators to control the length of "1" and "0" then all 8 are mixed and amplified. it is similar to (find EN article number that used 555 timers as a "resonator") p1 is a "filter" and p2 controls the maximum length in powers of 2 (max length is full wave, then half, 1/4 etc)

mSAW is 8 saw waves (4x oversampled) which are offset by -you guessed it!- 8 modulators. it is like a supersaw, but the individual waves never go "out of tune" 
p1 is a "filter" and p2 controls the maximum size of the offset (see mLEN above) tip! try controlling the filter frequency with SUB at about 1/4 max modulation, you can get an apparent octave change as you raise the frequency.

AB_AMP: (return of!) you can input audio signals to the A and B CV inputs, P2 is an amplifier control, which will boost or cut the input (with soft clipping) P1 is a "low pass filter". Note: the CV inputs the rest of the module sees have been smoothed with an averaging filter, in order to get the most bandwidth, this is bypassed and uses the raw CV input, It is by no means "HiFi" the sample rate is only 20.5 KHz and it can be noisy. also, the scope will not be in sync unless the incoming sound is at the same pitch the oscillator is playing at, however you can change the scope's "timebase" by playing a note. 
Test example: set LFO1 to play 220Hz, then set the AUX OUT 1 to outptut LFO1. Patch the AUX OUT 1 to the CV A input.
in OSC>HAX/AB_AMP mode, adjust amp and filter to suit. you should see a waveform on the scope, now play an "A" note on the MIDI or V/OCT in, you should see the wave standing still, play another note and it will move.



version 0.9.5.1
C>INTERNAL: Changed overclocking from 256 to 240MHz, some teensys were crashing after a variable amount of time and this seems to have fixed it for them. It meant the sample rate had to be changed to 44.1KHz. 

C>ALL: some screens, including Tune, LFO, Chaos, and Fuser screens have been tidied up.

C>MOD>FUSER: the release slider for the follower function has been reversed, to the right is longer decay.

N>MOD>LFO: the "reset to phase" position now indicated on the "scope" with dotted line.

N>MOD>XTRA: added "hustle" which is a modulator that increases in value the more MIDI note on or gates are recieved, and decreases over time.

C>INTERNAL>MOD>CHAOS: in some chaos attractors, the output could be a higher "voltage" than the maximum mod amount, it has been given the clamps!

B>MACRO: Fixed (again!) the shortcut to stereo page caused crash.

N>I/O>GateGen: added "Euclidean circles" gate generator.

B>FX> Extra non working sliders removed on fx 

B>

version 0.9.5
note: added these labels, 

C>I/O>INTERFACE>CONTROLSET: The vca page has had name changed the "output" diagram is gone, now there are 3 "windows" that swap around on the "routing" control, the sliders and sources follow them around. 
there are tiny 1-line meters between the 3 modules so you can see how the signal is flowing. (left to right)

K>MAY BE FINAL BOSS!>pressing shift does not return you to the previous screen after you do one of the shift actions.

N>MOD>FUSER: Added "DIFF" fuser type. it will return the difference between the 2 selected sources.
C>USER>MOD>FUSER>DISPLAY: added graphic display of the gatebuses state and selected gatebus "Gt#" (selected with BUT_LE) in the sample and hold fuser type.

B>FX>SOUND: Several effects were affected by an overload distortion in a soft clip routine causing distortion in some cases(the bad kind),

C+B>INTERNAL>FX>SOUND>soft clip2 was improved and fixed.

C+N>INTERNAL>FX>NOISE>SOUND>filter for "hypnoTOAD" noise was replaced with the same one that is on the LP noise.

C>INTERFACE>PHYSICAL: Left encoder selecting by "press-hold" replaced by "click turn click"

N>OSC>INTERFACE>DISPLAY: FPS and CPU% meter on osc mode screen

C>INTERNAL>INTERFACE>WORDS: the word "control" in mod sources was changed to "extra".

C>SYS>CONTROLSET: Removed horrible confusing scrolling thing from config page, load/save next?

B>B>OSC>PHYSICAL: long standing "turning encoders can sometimes crash module" bug fixed on osc screen

B>OSC>DISPLAY: fixed scope display breaking up at some tunings.

B>OSC>NOISE>: fixed the LP and BP noise cutting off at high levels of modulation.

N+C>FX>MAXAMP: "crush" effect is replaced by MaxAmp, it will amplify low level oscillators to the maximum level, for example when swarm is spread out, the level can get low, this will fix that.
attack is automatic, and decay can be adjusted, it can not be modulated at this time.
fast decay will respond quickly but will add some distortion, slower values take longer to respond, but the level of distortion is much lower. if it overloads due to slow decay and a sudden change, there is a soft clip.
there is still a crusher in the sample rate effect.

N>FX>ZPM new effect (zero point modulator) a simple modulator which only allows the modulation level to change when the input signal has crossed zero. this means that the envelope (or other modulator) does not distort the shape of the input waveform, and the shortest possible envelope is half a cycle (or until the first zero crossing) Idea may be stolen from WMD digital VCA.

C>I/O>STEREO>DISPLAY: cleaned up stereo page.
Stereo "difference" can now be modulated separately from pan.
there is a shortcut to the stereo page from the macro pot screen via right button.
the buttons were swapped, so old presets might be changed.

B>INTERNAL>V-AVERT>MACRO: Fixed macro pot was only half range.

N>OSC>SOUND+INTERFACE added reset to 90 degrees for osc reset modes (left button)
arrow symbol = no reset
box with "0" = reset to 0
box with "90" = reset to 90
box with "A0" = only reset to 0 when VCA is being used, and it is closed.

N>MOD>EXTRA: MIDI pressure added to "control" sources (now called extra)

C>Hz>MODULATION[global]: changed pitch bend max to 24 semitones 

N>Hz>MODULATION[global]: Pitch bend can be different for up and down, and also for osc 1 and osc 2

B>Hz>MODULATION[global]:fixed pitch bend sometimes would not zero.

K>Hz>MODULATION[global] only the o1 glide actually does anything for both oscs, mod source does not work

C>INTERFACE>DISPLAY:version now shown on button press even if VCA is closed

version 0.9.4.5
The macro knob is now bipolar.this means that your saved patch's stereo detune settings will be different, if it was being used.

Mixed wonky sustain slope on envelope diagram

Scan crossfade mode was moved to the scan controls page, you can switch with the left button. currently there are:
normal 11<>22 which fades between the 2 oscillator pairs
crossover 12<>21 which swaps oscillator 2's fade direction,

Shortcut to stereo page from macro control's page.

Basic screen saver, encoder move or button press to exit.(later version will alow disabling and change timer up ro 2550 seconds (approx)

Fixed sustain segment on env 3 and 4 (again)

MIDI notes on MIDI A now follow a "highest priority except the last note you played always plays"

Fixed a long standing "MIDI clicks sometimes on new note while envelope is open". it was velocity changing, DUH!

Now subsequent notes you play while the gate is open, will have the same velocity as the first note that opened the gate. (sorry advanced sequencer users, this will probably cause some confusion)


Version 0.9.4
Simple quantizer. it is the third page on "Hz".tuning comes after quantizing, so changing semitones on the tuning page will most likely result in out of scale notes.
there are global and patch scales, global scale and modulations are stored for all patches to use, when you are switched to global, loading a new patch will not change the scale that is playing (but patches scale will be loaded, and you can switch to "patch" and use it).
patch scale and modulations are saved with the patch, if you are switched to "patch", then the scale is saved and loaded with the patch.

Center position on scan is the root scale and root note.the second scale after "OFF" called "MIDI B" will toggle notes on the scale from the MIDI B channel.(MIDI B scale is not saved)
Osc positions let you modulate the quantizer inputs individually for osc1 and osc 2. if you use "MAX" as the modulater, you can control an fixed offset that is alway in your scale. 
Quantizer output gates are available in the gate generators (they are too fast to be seen on the gate matrix, later ill make the length of them modualateable via a mod source).

Gate matrix has been expanded to include MIDI B note-on/off
Gate matrix rules are more easy to understand:
"ANY" any gate with a selected "pin" on the matrix will output on that gate bus row.
"1 on" will output a gate when only 1 of the selected gates is on
"2 on" will output a gate when 2 selected gates are on
"0 on" will output a gate when all selected gates are off

Added a new fuser function: "sample and hold" works like a normal one, input a modulator, and select a gate bus with the left button.
Added a (possibly quite useless) source to the "control" modulator, it corresponds to the MIDI clock BPM. zero is 0, 500 is maximum.

Kenvelopes.


Version 0.9.2
Added "SHIFT" system for 3 shortcuts. press sys to shift, screen will say shift and show the functions. you can do: MIDI PANIC which will turn off MIDI notes if your DAW or sequencer forgot to.
VCA toggle turns the output VCA on and off
save state saves the current patch to EEPROM, you can use that to save when autosave is off (option on config page)

Added "push left encoder select dots" to SYS and I/O (like mod and FX already have).
Yet another rework of envelope window.
Fixed the modulator context sometimes not working. when you are on an attenuverter page (pot buttons) pressing MOD should take you to the modulator that is being used by that control (if it has a page!).

version 0.9.1
added "calibration helper"
when calibrating v/octave you can press the left screen button to get "100"which is percentage of current frequency. that means double the frequency will show 200, and half will show 50. it makes adjusting calibration easier.

Version 0.9.0
Fixed a problem where the DAC would not start with some teensys(newer version?)

Version 0.8.5
Changed envelope display so the "diagram" is larger.and hopefully the controls are easier to navigate

Sub oscillator added parameters
besides bank and wave, you can now pick 1 or 2 octaves down, pick what it follows (osc1, osc2 or global tune) and pick maximum note it will play (the note it plays will "fold over", say you set note 64 as the max note, then it will play an octave down each time it gets above note 64) 

Fixed lfo reset phase not changing much.

Added "blind modes" When in the osc screen you can press the osc button again to toggle changing the opposite oscillator mode and methods
that way you can change the oscillator which you can not see or hear then when you fade back to it you will hear a different sound.

fixed negative sustain slope showing large number

Version 0.8.3

Replaced first envelope curve with new "capacitor" curve which is shaped like an analog envelope.

Fixed "catch up" Pot controls will start at the position saved in a patch, an XOR line will appear on the attenuverter page showing position of the current pots value, and a small mark beside the pot and modulation indicator showing where the patch value is. when the line meets the mark, then the pot "catches" and will follow the turning of the potentiometer. The small mark remains to show the patch starting point for reference,

Scan LEDs will blink when pot is not caught. (removed, it was sort of annoying)

on the mode screen, uncaught pots are indicated on top of the scope with up/dn triangles showing the direction to turn in order to "catch" them.

Added "0 velocity" control to the  VCA/SUB/FX routing screen controls, for no velocity control, leave it at maximum, as it is reduced, it lowers the level which will be output with zero velocity, while maximum velocity will output maximum level. when using with v/oct, after using with MIDI, the velocity will be maximized after the envelope has closed.

note: velocity only works when the output VCA is being controlled by an envelope or gate.

Added "use"[CC number] on config page. when MIDI CC is detected, you can press left screen button to apply that CC to one of the 4 CC slots.

On output VCA/FX screen you can press left button to change the VCA from linear to exponential. there is an icon in the bottom left corner with a ramp or curve.

On the Fusers, "expo" has been added to allow using exponential versions of internal modulator "voltages" (note, this "exponential converter" is actually based on a cube law, so voltages below 0 will be "anti exponential")

version 0.8.1
changed global settings screen, now saves MIDI channel and CCs, as well as program change enable.returned the frequency readout on calibration.

fixed reversed right encoder on gate matrix

fixed missing "pitch follow" icon indicator on resonator FX (right screen button) works the same as osc modes that have an element that can follow pitch

removed extra "do nothing" sliders on some effects

switch scope view with left encoder click (mode screen) instead of confusing it with right button "pitch follow enable" in some modes

fixed: MIDI was resetting oscs on every note on. (when reset was on)

Slowed down "virus" sustain ramp

Re-ordered SYS button screens, load/save is first 
sample rate screen is "hidden" only visible by multiple presses of SYS, not left encoder press-turn.

version 0.8.0:
Patch file load and save from SD "PRESET" folder

press right button to make resonator FX follow pitch. the pitch slider becomes offset there is no indicator yet.

removed hard wired CV to virtual attenuverter pages, the "catch" pot indicator will go there. (not working, patches load to where the pots are currently)

separate left and right pitch modulation amount and source per osc.

todo: WE files try to load more than actual number of files. errors briefly pop up.
global set page MIDI channel and secondary MIDI channel, allow program change to work toggle.
