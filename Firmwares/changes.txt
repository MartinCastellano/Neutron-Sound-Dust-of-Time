version 0.9.4.5
The macro knob is now bipolar.this means that your saved patch's stereo detune settings will be different, if it was being used.

Macro knob display now shows how it is actually working. on macro the pot does what the right encoder usually does on the other potscreens. the start point is always zero, so when the knob is in the middle, there is no output to the "macro" modulation source.

Mixed wonky sustain slope on envelope diagram

Scan crossfade mode was moved to the scan controls page, you can switch with the left button. currently there are:
normal 11<>22 which fades between the 2 oscillator pairs
crossover 12<>21 which swaps oscillator 2's fade direction,

Shortcut to stereo page from macro control's page.

Basic screen saver, encoder move or button press to exit.(later version will alow disabling and change timer up ro 2550 seconds (approx)

Fixed sustain segment on env 3 and 4 (again)

MIDI notes on MIDI A now follow a "highest priority except the last note you played always plays"

Fixed a long standing "MIDI clicks sometimes on new note while envelope is open". it was velocity changing, DUH!

Now subsequent notes you play while the gate is open, will have the same velocity as the first note that opened the gate. (sorry advanced sequencer users, this will probably cause some confusion)


Version 0.9.4
Simple quantizer. it is the third page on "Hz".tuning comes after quantizing, so changing semitones on the tuning page will most likely result in out of scale notes.
there are global and patch scales, global scale and modulations are stored for all patches to use, when you are switched to global, loading a new patch will not change the scale that is playing (but patches scale will be loaded, and you can switch to "patch" and use it).
patch scale and modulations are saved with the patch, if you are switched to "patch", then the scale is saved and loaded with the patch.

Center position on scan is the root scale and root note.the second scale after "OFF" called "MIDI B" will toggle notes on the scale from the MIDI B channel.(MIDI B scale is not saved)
Osc positions let you modulate the quantizer inputs individually for osc1 and osc 2. if you use "MAX" as the modulater, you can control an fixed offset that is alway in your scale. 
Quantizer output gates are available in the gate generators (they are too fast to be seen on the gate matrix, later ill make the length of them modualateable via a mod source).

Gate matrix has been expanded to include MIDI B note-on/off
Gate matrix rules are more easy to understand:
"ANY" any gate with a selected "pin" on the matrix will output on that gate bus row.
"1 on" will output a gate when only 1 of the selected gates is on
"2 on" will output a gate when 2 selected gates are on
"0 on" will output a gate when all selected gates are off

Added a new fuser function: "sample and hold" works like a normal one, input a modulator, and select a gate bus with the left button.
Added a (possibly quite useless) source to the "control" modulator, it corresponds to the MIDI clock BPM. zero is 0, 500 is maximum.

Kenvelopes.


Version 0.9.2
Added "SHIFT" system for 3 shortcuts. press sys to shift, screen will say shift and show the functions. you can do: MIDI PANIC which will turn off MIDI notes if your DAW or sequencer forgot to.
VCA toggle turns the output VCA on and off
save state saves the current patch to EEPROM, you can use that to save when autosave is off (option on config page)

Added "push left encoder select dots" to SYS and I/O (like mod and FX already have).
Yet another rework of envelope window.
Fixed the modulator context sometimes not working. when you are on an attenuverter page (pot buttons) pressing MOD should take you to the modulator that is being used by that control (if it has a page!).

version 0.9.1
added "calibration helper"
when calibrating v/octave you can press the left screen button to get "100"which is percentage of current frequency. that means double the frequency will show 200, and half will show 50. it makes adjusting calibration easier.

Version 0.9.0
Fixed a problem where the DAC would not start with some teensys(newer version?)

Version 0.8.5
Changed envelope display so the "diagram" is larger.and hopefully the controls are easier to navigate

Sub oscillator added parameters
besides bank and wave, you can now pick 1 or 2 octaves down, pick what it follows (osc1, osc2 or global tune) and pick maximum note it will play (the note it plays will "fold over", say you set note 64 as the max note, then it will play an octave down each time it gets above note 64) 

Fixed lfo reset phase not changing much.

Added "blind modes" When in the osc screen you can press the osc button again to toggle changing the opposite oscillator mode and methods
that way you can change the oscillator which you can not see or hear then when you fade back to it you will hear a different sound.

fixed negative sustain slope showing large number

Version 0.8.3

Replaced first envelope curve with new "capacitor" curve which is shaped like an analog envelope.

Fixed "catch up" Pot controls will start at the position saved in a patch, an XOR line will appear on the attenuverter page showing position of the current pots value, and a small mark beside the pot and modulation indicator showing where the patch value is. when the line meets the mark, then the pot "catches" and will follow the turning of the potentiometer. The small mark remains to show the patch starting point for reference,

Scan LEDs will blink when pot is not caught. (removed, it was sort of annoying)

on the mode screen, uncaught pots are indicated on top of the scope with up/dn triangles showing the direction to turn in order to "catch" them.

Added "0 velocity" control to the  VCA/SUB/FX routing screen controls, for no velocity control, leave it at maximum, as it is reduced, it lowers the level which will be output with zero velocity, while maximum velocity will output maximum level. when using with v/oct, after using with MIDI, the velocity will be maximized after the envelope has closed.

note: velocity only works when the output VCA is being controlled by an envelope or gate.

Added "use"[CC number] on config page. when MIDI CC is detected, you can press left screen button to apply that CC to one of the 4 CC slots.

On output VCA/FX screen you can press left button to change the VCA from linear to exponential. there is an icon in the bottom left corner with a ramp or curve.

On the Fusers, "expo" has been added to allow using exponential versions of internal modulator "voltages" (note, this "exponential converter" is actually based on a cube law, so voltages below 0 will be "anti exponential")

version 0.8.1
changed global settings screen, now saves MIDI channel and CCs, as well as program change enable.returned the frequency readout on calibration.

fixed reversed right encoder on gate matrix

fixed missing "pitch follow" icon indicator on resonator FX (right screen button) works the same as osc modes that have an element that can follow pitch

removed extra "do nothing" sliders on some effects

switch scope view with left encoder click (mode screen) instead of confusing it with right button "pitch follow enable" in some modes

fixed: MIDI was resetting oscs on every note on. (when reset was on)

Slowed down "virus" sustain ramp

Re-ordered SYS button screens, load/save is first 
sample rate screen is "hidden" only visible by multiple presses of SYS, not left encoder press-turn.

version 0.8.0:
Patch file load and save from SD "PRESET" folder

press right button to make resonator FX follow pitch. the pitch slider becomes offset there is no indicator yet.

removed hard wired CV to virtual attenuverter pages, the "catch" pot indicator will go there. (not working, patches load to where the pots are currently)

separate left and right pitch modulation amount and source per osc.

todo: WE files try to load more than actual number of files. errors briefly pop up.
global set page MIDI channel and secondary MIDI channel, allow program change to work toggle.
