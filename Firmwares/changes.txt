Version 0.8.5
Added "blind modes" When in the osc screen you can press the osc button again to toggle changing the opposite oscillator mode and methods
that way you can change the oscillator which you can not see or hear then when you fade back to it you will hear a different sound.

fixed negative sustain slope showing large number

Version 0.8.3

Replaced first envelope curve with new "capacitor" curve which is shaped like an analog envelope.

Fixed "catch up" Pot controls will start at the position saved in a patch, an XOR line will appear on the attenuverter page showing position of the current pots value, and a small mark beside the pot and modulation indicator showing where the patch value is. when the line meets the mark, then the pot "catches" and will follow the turning of the potentiometer. The small mark remains to show the patch starting point for reference,

Scan LEDs will blink when pot is not caught. (removed, it was sort of annoying)

on the mode screen, uncaught pots are indicated on top of the scope with up/dn triangles showing the direction to turn in order to "catch" them.

Added "0 velocity" control to the  VCA/SUB/FX routing screen controls, for no velocity control, leave it at maximum, as it is reduced, it lowers the level which will be output with zero velocity, while maximum velocity will output maximum level. when using with v/oct, after using with MIDI, the velocity will be maximized after the envelope has closed.

note: velocity only works when the output VCA is being controlled by an envelope or gate.

Added "use"[CC number] on config page. when MIDI CC is detected, you can press left screen button to apply that CC to one of the 4 CC slots.

On output VCA/FX screen you can press left button to change the VCA from linear to exponential. there is an icon in the bottom left corner with a ramp or curve.

On the Fusers, "expo" has been added to allow using exponential versions of internal modulator "voltages" (note, this "exponential converter" is actually based on a cube law, so voltages below 0 will be "anti exponential")

version 0.8.1
changed global settings screen, now saves MIDI channel and CCs, as well as program change enable.returned the frequency readout on calibration.

fixed reversed right encoder on gate matrix

fixed missing "pitch follow" icon indicator on resonator FX (right screen button) works the same as osc modes that have an element that can follow pitch

removed extra "do nothing" sliders on some effects

switch scope view with left encoder click (mode screen) instead of confusing it with right button "pitch follow enable" in some modes

fixed: MIDI was resetting oscs on every note on. (when reset was on)

Slowed down "virus" sustain ramp

Re-ordered SYS button screens, load/save is first 
sample rate screen is "hidden" only visible by multiple presses of SYS, not left encoder press-turn.

version 0.8.0:
Patch file load and save from SD "PRESET" folder

press right button to make resonator FX follow pitch. the pitch slider becomes offset there is no indicator yet.

removed hard wired CV to virtual attenuverter pages, the "catch" pot indicator will go there. (not working, patches load to where the pots are currently)

separate left and right pitch modulation amount and source per osc.

todo: WE files try to load more than actual number of files. errors briefly pop up.
global set page MIDI channel and secondary MIDI channel, allow program change to work toggle.
